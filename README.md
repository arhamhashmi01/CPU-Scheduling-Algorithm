# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
Welcome to the CPU Scheduling Algorithms Implementation repository in Python! This repository hosts the implementation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.

CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems where the scheduler decides which processes to run in what order. Understanding and implementing various scheduling algorithms are essential for computer science students and professionals alike.

In this repository, you will find clear and concise Python implementations of the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** This is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive.

**Shortest Job First (SJF):** This algorithm selects the process with the shortest burst time next, aiming to minimize average waiting time.

**Priority Scheduling:** Processes are assigned priorities, and the scheduler selects the process with the highest priority for execution.

**Round Robin:** Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum), and the scheduler rotates among the processes, executing each for a predetermined amount of time before moving to the next.

Each algorithm implementation is accompanied by clear documentation and examples to help you understand the logic behind the code and how to use it effectively.
